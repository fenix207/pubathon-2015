"10 weeks, 10 papers" 

**How it works**    
Each week an new theme arises (see [Gplus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/113620706114893538778/stream/81bc1d79-28e5-4233-a509-6044a51bba4d). Regardless, each week, any contribution will get you 10 points. All you need to do is make progress, and drop url in Gplus to get credit. Standing double-point bonus is if you update your own score by forking this [csv](https://github.com/sr320/pubathon-2015/blob/master/data/tally.csv)
